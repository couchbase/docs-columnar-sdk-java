{description}


The {sdk_dot_minor} {name-sdk} requires Java 17 or later to be installed.
We recommend using the most recent long-term support (LTS) version of OpenJDK.

TIP: Remember to keep your Java installation up to date with the latest patches.


== Platform Compatibility


=== JDK Version Compatibility

include::{sdk_api}@columnar-sdk:shared:partial$compatibility.adoc[tag=jdk-version]





=== OS Compatibility

include::{sdk_api}@columnar-sdk:shared:partial$compatibility.adoc[tag=os-compat-jvm]





=== Network Requirements

include::{sdk_api}@columnar-sdk:shared:partial$network-requirements.adoc[tag=lan-like]






== Capella Columnar Compatibility


Capella Columnar is a fully hosted service, continually updated, and offering the latest version --
with users having a few weeks to upgrade from the previous version.
As such, the latest Couchbase Columnar SDKs are tested against the latest versions.
Where older versions of the {name-sdk} pre-date significant new features in Columar, those differences will be noted in this section.


To make development easier, the SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.
